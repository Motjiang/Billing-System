# ðŸ§¾ Golang CLI Billing System

A clean, beginner-friendly **Command Line Billing System** built in **Golang**. This project was developed as part of my journey to learn Go and understand how to work with structs, maps, pointers, user input, file writing, and more.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Description

This CLI program allows a user to generate a bill by entering items and prices, adding a tip, and saving the final bill to a text file inside a `bills/` folder. The file is named using the customer's name and contains a formatted breakdown of all bill items, tip, and the total.
